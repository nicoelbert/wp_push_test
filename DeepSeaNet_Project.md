# Project Title: **DeepSeaNet**: A Deep Learning Model for Oceanic Data Analysis

## Overview
The **DeepSeaNet** project is a cutting-edge research initiative aimed at leveraging _deep learning_ techniques to analyze vast amounts of oceanographic data. This project is a collaboration between the **Institute of Data Science** and the **Marine Biology Center**.

---

## Goals and Objectives
- **Primary Objective**: Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify underwater species from sonar images.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
  1. Build a time-series model to predict water temperature fluctuations.
  2. Analyze salinity data to understand ocean currents.
  3. Publish findings in open-access journals.

---

## Dataset
We are using the following datasets:
- **NOAA Ocean Data**: [NOAA Database](https://www.noaa.gov/data)
- **Marine Life Sonar Images** (proprietary)
- Simulated data generated using Python libraries.

```python
# Example of data simulation in Python
import numpy as np

# Simulating water temperature data
temperature = np.random.normal(loc=15, scale=3, size=1000)
print(temperature[:10])
```

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
1. **Cleaning**: Remove noise from sonar images using Gaussian filters.
2. **Normalization**: Scale features to a 0-1 range.
3. **Augmentation**: Apply random rotations and flips to increase dataset diversity.

### Model Architecture
We propose a hybrid architecture combining:
- **ResNet50** for feature extraction.
- **GRU** for sequential data analysis.

```yaml
# Pseudocode for the architecture
Model:
  FeatureExtractor: ResNet50
  SequenceAnalyzer: GRU
  Optimizer: Adam
  LossFunction: CrossEntropyLoss
```
