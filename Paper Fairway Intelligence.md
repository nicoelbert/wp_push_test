# FAIRWAY INTELLIGENCE: Enhancing Golf Performance with Digital Twins and Data-Driven Decision-Making

## Overview
This paper introduces a groundbreaking Decision Support System (DSS) for golf, utilizing digital twins to revolutionize in-game tactics and long-term training. The system integrates player profiles with geospatial data of golf courses to create realistic simulations. These simulations aid players of all levels in enhancing their performance.

## Key Features
1. **Shot Recommendation Engine**: Provides tactical in-game recommendations tailored to a playerâ€™s position, skill, and risk preferences.
2. **Training Information System**: Identifies areas for skill improvement and provides strategic guidance for long-term development.

***

## Digital Twin Integration
- **Player Digital Twin**: Captures metrics like shot distance, club speed, and swing precision.
- **Course Digital Twin**: Maps detailed geospatial data, including fairways, hazards, and elevation changes.

The integration of these components allows the DSS to model shots, optimize decisions, and evaluate performance under various conditions.

***

## Methodology
- **Physics-Based Simulations**: Models realistic shot trajectories, accounting for terrain, club type, and player skill.
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: Evaluates optimal strategies and guides shot selection based on dynamic course conditions.

***

## Results
- Risk-neutral agents provided the most consistent performance across simulations.
- Aggressive strategies showed higher rewards but increased variability, while defensive strategies minimized risk.

The DSS demonstrates significant potential to enhance decision-making in golf, offering tailored insights to optimize both tactical and strategic elements of play.

***

## Applications
1. **Game Play Optimization**: Real-time shot recommendations improve in-game decisions.
2. **Training Plans**: Customized objectives focus on areas like precision or distance to maximize performance improvements.
3. **Accessibility**: The DSS is available via an intuitive GUI and integrates with wearable devices for seamless adoption.

***

## Conclusion
The DSS leverages data-rich digital twins and simulations to provide actionable insights for players. Future developments include integrating real-time tournament analytics and enhancing physics engines for even greater realism.
